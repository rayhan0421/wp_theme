 Important! Do not use page- as a prefix, as WordPress will interpret the file as a specialized template, 
meant to apply to only one page on your site.

.............
If no page templates are assigned to a page and no templates match the page slug or ID of the page,
then WordPress will use the default page template page.php.
 And if no page.php template exists, it will use index.php.
