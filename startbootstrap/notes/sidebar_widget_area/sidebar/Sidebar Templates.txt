Sidebar templates are typically a php file where the code for a dynamic sidebar are added. Most of the WordPress theme has a single sidebar template file called sidebar.php. But you have more template files. For example: Twenty Thirteen theme uses two sidebar template files called sidebar.php and sidebar-main.php, where dynamic sidebar sidebar-1 code is added in sidebar-main.php and sidebar-2 code is added in sidebar.php file.

Now, you have to use get_sidebar( $name ); function to loads both of these sidebar templates. In Twenty Thirteen theme used the following functions to load both of the sidebar template.

:::
<?php 
//Loading sidebar.php file
get_sidebar(); 
?>
 
<?php 
//Loading sidebar-main.php file
get_sidebar( 'main' ); ?>

notes:
Sidebar templates don’t actually have to display dynamic sidebars. 
They can technically contain custom-coded content that displays anything. 
At the same time, you can display a dynamic sidebar in any template file you like.
